			<h2>Bio</h2>
			<p>I am a trans woman that loves solving problems by using code. 
			I enjoy experimenting with what ever interests me at the time and 
			develop tech demos. I also love developing prototypes for games 
			using Unity or the Unreal Engine. In my free time I like to play 
			video games and occasionally I like to try drawing and I have dabbled 
			in 3D graphics.</p>
			<h2>Education</h2>
			<p>I graduated the Oregon Institute of Technology in 2023 with a Bachelor's 
				degree in Software Engineering. During my time at OIT I learned how to
				program C, C++, and C#. I worked on numerous 
				<a href="https://github.com/DezzyTheDragon/OITLabwork">assignments and projects</a> 
				such as a compiler, several multithreaded
				assignments, and networking applications. I also learned how to solve problems and 
				quickly	learn new programming lanugages and technologies.</p>
			<h2>Experience</h2>
			<p>During high school I was part of a FIRST Robotics Competition team.
				I was on team 1359 The Scalawags. 
				In <a href="https://github.com/1359Scalawags/2017Robot">2017</a> I was 
				the only programmer on the team and used C++ that year. In 
				<a href="https://github.com/1359Scalawags/2018Robot">2018</a> and 
				<a href="https://github.com/1359Scalawags/2019Robot">2019</a> I was 
				one of two programmers on the team and we used java for both years.</p>
			<h2>Projects</h2>
			<!--============================================================================-->
			<h3>Magic RPG</h3>
			<img class="center-image" src="assets/MagicRPGBanner.png" alt="Magic RPG Logo">
			<p>Currently working on a <a href="https://github.com/DezzyTheDragon/MagicRPG">Minecraft mod</a> 
				that adds a magic system to the game. The player will be able to find and equip a small variaty 
				of spells. Players will also be able to	level up using a skill tree to change how spells behave 
				allowing for a small variety of	builds.
			</p>

			<h3>Portfolio Page</h3>
			<p>I created this 
			<a href="https://github.com/DezzyTheDragon/DezzyTheDragon.github.io">portfolio</a> 
			in order to better condense my information. I may not be an expert in HTML and CSS 
			I do understand the basics and can put together a basic website.</p>
			<!--============================================================================-->
			<h3>Laser Puzzle</h3>
			<p>I made a simple <a href="https://github.com/DezzyTheDragon/LaserPuzzle.git">laser puzzle</a> 
			prototype where the player can redirect lasers using mirrors or change 
			the color of lasers using filters. The player must direct the correct 
			color laser to hit the corect sensors. This is one of my first attempts
			in using the Unreal Engine so a large part was learning how to use the
			software and how Blueprints work.</p>

			<h3>VoxelBox</h3>
			<p>I attempted to make a Minecraft like game called 
			<a href="https://github.com/DezzyTheDragon/VoxelBox">VoxelBox</a>, 
			using C++ and OpenGL. The purpose of this project was to practice OpenGL 
			and try to understand some basic game archetecture. While I wasn't able 
			to finish the project I did get plenty of practice in C++ and OpenGL.</p>
