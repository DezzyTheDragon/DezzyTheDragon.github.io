			<h2>Education</h2>
			<p>I graduated the Oregon Institute of Technology in 2023 with a Bachelor's 
				degree in Software Engineering. During my time at OIT I learned how to
				program C, C++, and C#. I also learned how to solve problems and quickly
				learn new programming lanugages and technologies.</p>
			<h2>Experience</h2>
			<p>During high school I was part of a FIRST Robotics Competition team.
				I was on team 1359 The Scalawags. 
				In <a href="https://github.com/1359Scalawags/2017Robot">2017</a> I was 
				the only programmer on the team and used C++ that year. In 
				<a href="https://github.com/1359Scalawags/2018Robot">2018</a> and 
				<a href="https://github.com/1359Scalawags/2019Robot">2019</a> I was 
				one of two programmers on the team and we used java for both years.</p>
			<h2>Projects</h2>
			<h3>Portfolio Page</h3>
			<p>I created this 
			<a href="https://github.com/DezzyTheDragon/DezzyTheDragon.github.io">portfolio</a> 
			in order to better condense my information. I may not be an expert in HTML and CSS 
			I do understand the basics and can put together a basic website.</p>
